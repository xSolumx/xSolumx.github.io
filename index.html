                  <p>
                     As far as hobbies go, I love reading books;
                     that's probably my main hobby considering I've
                     read about 0.321 books per day in the past year.
                     I mainly read Sci-fi and Fantasy novels, some
                     memorable books to me are: The Name of the Wind,
                     Ringworld, Foundation, Dune (all OG 6.
                     myFavourite: "God Emperor Of Dune"), Speaker For
                     The Dead, and everything by Terry Pratchet or
                     Isaac Asimov.

                     I've also enjoyed Gaming throughout my life, I
                     probably play more strategy games than anything
                     else, Civ 5, Civ 6(still prefer 5 tho), Cities
                     Skylines, Stellaris, Anno 1800. I'm constantly
                     picking up indie games when I find myself
                     lacking creative energy, the innovation and
                     design choices in indie games really inspires
                     me. I also just enjoy looking at pretty design.

                     Technology has also been a major passion
                     throughout my life. I always loved seeing new
                     technology come out when I was a child, and I
                     still follow Nvidia, AMD, and intel; just to see
                     who's on top. It's incredible to witness how
                     technology has evolved over the years. From
                     artificial intelligence and machine learning to
                     virtual and augmented reality, the possibilities
                     seem endless. I'm amazed by the power of modern
                     computers and the Rapid race of AI
                     revolutionaries, bringing us closer to
                     intelligent automation and incredible
                     application of natural language processing and
                     computer vision into modern life. Also NASA,
                     because they have invented and innovated so much
                     in the realm of Technology. They also give us
                     cool pictures of the galaxy to look at.

                  <p>
                     I Started programming games using Bash scripts
                     when i was 10 years younger. Making text based
                     RPG games where you could explore dungeons and
                     interact with the challenges presented in each
                     room. Ever since then, i've been absolutely
                     fascinated by programming and what you can
                     create out of different languages with just your
                     imagination and a little bit of reading
                     documentation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     In 2019 I founded and managed a small business
                     where I led a team in creating a game server.
                     The game server catered to Minecraft players and
                     hosted 13,000 unique people and 30 active
                     members playing on average.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Through doing this, I gained valuable experience
                     in project management and team leadership as
                     well as technical experience in Java, Maven,
                     Jenkins, Linux based operating systems and,
                     Systems Administration. As well as refining my
                     Design skills through creating custom assets for
                     the project, as well as Digital Art skills in
                     primarily photshop as well as other design
                     software

                  <p>
                     I've been using Java since 2019 as it was
                     integral to my work back then. I've used a lot
                     of external libraries and API's i Java. I've
                     also extended the functionality of many Plugins
                     to make it suit my specific requirements.

                     SQL get's tiring.. But sometimes you just have
                     to do it.

                  <p>
                     I've expermimented a lot with creating Machine
                     Learning Models, Python has been my main
                     language for this. i've created image detection
                     models, risk analysis models, and many other
                     prediction models. I generraly incorporate
                     TensorFlow into my code, since i Wan't my model
                     trained in 10 minutes rather than 10 hours.
                     Overall i really love Machine Learning and what
                     it encompasses, I get addicted to creating
                     models and refining them until they are as
                     accurate as i can possibly make them.
