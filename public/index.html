               <p>I am an aspiring software developer in his last year of university with experience using programming
                  and scripting languages, such as JavaScript, C# and Java. I founded and managed a small business where
                  I led a team in creating a game server. The game server mainly catered to Minecraft users and hosted
                  13,000 unique players and 20 players on the server on average. Through doing this, I gained valuable
                  experience in project management and team leadership as well as technical experience in Java and
                  Photoshop.</p>

         <h2 class="card-title">A Litle Bit About Myself</h2>
         <div class="card-text">
            <ul>
               <li class="m">I'm Hayden Austin. As far as hobbies go, I love reading books; 
                  that's probably my main hobby considering I've read about 0.321 books per day in 
                  the past year. I mainly read Sci-fi and Fantasy novels, some memorable books to me 
                  are: The Name of the Wind, Ringworld, Foundation, Dune (all OG 6. myFavourite: 
                  "God Emperor Of Dune"), Speaker For The Dead, and everything Terry Pratchet.</li>
               <li class="m">I've also enjoyed Gaming throughout my life, I bought an overkill PC just 
                  to play Minecraft. I probably play more strategy games than anything else, 
                  Civ 5, Civ 6(still prefer 5 tho), Cities Skylines, Stellaris, Anno 1800. 
                  I'm constantly picking up indie games when I find myself lacking creative energy, 
                  the innovation and design choices in indie games really inspires me, i also just 
                  enjoy looking at pretty design.</li>  
               <li class="m">Technology has also been a major passion throughout my life. 
                  I always loved seeing new technology come out when I was a child, 
                  and I still follow Nvidia, AMD, and intel; just to see who's on top. 
                  It's incredible to witness how technology has evolved over the years. 
                  From artificial intelligence and machine learning to virtual and augmented reality, 
                  the possibilities seem endless. I'm amazed by the power of modern computers and the 
                  Rapid race of AI revolutionaries, bringing us closer to intelligent automation and 
                  incredible application of natural language processing and computer vision into 
                  modern life. Also NASA, because they have invented and innovated so 
                  much in the realm of Technology. And they also give us cool pictures of 
                  the galaxy to look at.</li>
               <li class="m">I'd also say i'm an ex-artist; i barely draw or paint anymore. 
                  However drawing and doodling is something i've done since i can remember 
                  and i still have a strong passion for Art and good design</li>

         <h1 class="card-title">A Brief Overview Of My Programming Experience</h1>
         <div class="card-text">
            <h4>2019-2023</h4>
            <p>Current Life at Belgium Campus</p>
            <ul style="list-style: disc;">
               <li>Honestly i can't say i've achieved much on a grand scale beyond surviving here, so i'll just say what i think about my experience learning at Belgium Campus</li>
               <li>I've loved every programming class so far. Ecspecially Web Programming, though that may be purely because i had such a great lecturer. there's a class called SAD(Sofware Analysis and Design) and the title SAD really does fit what it's like. Theory subjects just don't get my brain working enough</li>
               <li>i've been doing small programming projects or tests to learn new things, because i don't get nearly enough programming classes during the year</li>
               <li>I've enjoyed the fast paced learning style</li>
               <li>I enjoyed MLG382 so much that i've started playing around with public datasets and training some models myself</li>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beyond Higschool</p>
            <ul style="list-style: disc;">
               <li>Founded a successful Minecraft server with a modest $40 capital investment</li>
               <li>Turned half a million Rand return in 2 years</li>
               <li>Managed a team of up to 12 people</li>
               <li>Honed important skills, including:</li>
               <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                  <li>Strategic design principles</li>
                  <li>Content moderation</li>
                  <li>Linux server configuration and maintenance</li>
                  <li>Java programming</li>
                  <li>Teamwork and adaptability</li>
                  <li>Project management</li>
                  <li>Optimizing systems</li>
                  <li>Communication</li>
               </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2015-2018</h4>
            <p>High School</p>
            <ul style="list-style: disc;">
               <li>In high school I created Java games and virtual 3D worlds outside of class for my assignments and
                  projects.</li>

               <li>I developed a strong relationship with the school's IT department, and contributed significantly by
                  reconfiguring the Wi-Fi setup and attending CISCO training sessions alongside the regular technicians.
               </li>

               <li>I co-founded the 'Computers Club' to teach programming skills to fellow students and conduct hardware
                  experiments using the school's resources, leading to enjoyable learning experiences and personal
                  growth.</li>
            <!-- </ul>
            <h4>2009-2014</h4>
            <p>Early Years</p>
            <ul style="list-style: disc;">
               <li>As an early enthusiast of technology and programming, I discovered my love for programming at the age
                  of 8, when I began creating text adventure games using batch scripting. This
                  early experience ignited a passion within me, motivating me to delve deeper into the world of
                  computers.</li>
               <li>In my eagerness to learn, I would often take apart laptops and desktops, and then
                  reassemble them to gain a better understanding of their inner workings. These experiences fostered a
                  lifelong curiosity in the field of computing.</li>
